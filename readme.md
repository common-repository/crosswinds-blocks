Take your website to the next level with the Crosswinds Blocks plugin!

The Crosswinds Blocks plugin adds in even more functionality to help you take your website to the next level.

The core of the plugin is the block library that adds in simple but powerful blocks that you can use in your posts and pages. There are blocks that add in post navigation and related posts sections for your blog pages. You can also add in social sharing sections so people can share your content with their friends and followers.

There are also accordion and tab sections that allow you to present a lot of information in a contained space. And there are very simple blocks that make tricky things, like breadcrumbs and the copyright date for your footer, super easy.

And for those who want to scratch their design, it comes with a grid block to help you create complex designs as well as tools for using flex box on all group and column blocks. Oh, and it helps you a lot with the responsiveness for all of your designs, so your website will look great no matter what device it’s viewed on.

As you’ll see, it’s a very simple plugin but it can add a whole lot to your website, even if you don’t use one of the Crosswinds Framework themes.

## Blocks
Currently there are over 15 blocks you can add to your templates, template parts, posts and pages. These blocks range from a simple marquee to post navigation to more complex sections like accordions and tabs.

### Accordions
The accordions block allows you to add an accordion section to your content. This can be really useful for frequently asked questions or any other section of content where you have a lot of information to share but don’t want to take up too much space on the page.

### Advanced Custom Fields Field Block
The ACF Field block allows you to display the value of a basic ACF field in your content. This block does not work for fields like the gallery, repeater or options.

### Author Social Icons
Add links to the social media profiles, website and/or email of the author of posts and other content.

### Basic Grid
The basic grid block allows you to create a simple grid of items. This can be really helpful in showing off a list of features for a product or service or a list of services that you offer. And you can control how many columns are shown at mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

### Comments Number
Display the number of comments that a post has.

### Copyright
The copyright block allows you to display a copyright date and text on your page (most likely in the footer). And you won’t have to worry about updating the date every year.

### Marquee
The marquee block allows you to show a section of horizontally scrolling text in your content. This can help call attention to something you want — like a sale. It’s not recommended that you use this block a whole lot on your site, but it can be helpful when used right.

### Post Navigation
The Next Post and Previous Post blocks allow you to customize how your post navigation looks beyond the default WordPress blocks. The Next Post block will show the next chronological post so that a reader can read another post. The Previous Post block will show the previous chronological post. And you’ll be able to customize how those posts will look, just like you can inside a query block.

### Post Type Search Results
The Post Type Search Results block allows you to display custom queries and post templates on your search page template based on the post type that's being searched.

### Related Posts
The Related Posts Block allows you to display a number of related posts so that a reader can continue to read more of your block posts. It’s a great way to increase the amount of time someone spends on your website.

### Single Content
The Single Content block allows you to display a specific post, page or other post type on the page. You can customize how it looks similar to how you can customize the posts in the query loop block.

### Search Filters
The Search Filters blocks allow you to create custom search filters for every post type on your website and gives you the ability to create search functionality that helps your users.

### Skills Slider
The Skills Slider block allows you to display a visual representation of how well you know certain skills, such as web development, editing, shooting video, etc.

### Social Share Content
The Social Share Content block allows you to show an area on a post, page or other custom post type so that a user can share that content to a social network with a click of the button.

### Tabs
The Tabs block allows you to create a tabbed section in your content. You can align the tabs either horizontally across the top or vertically along the left side. This can be another great way to present a lot of information but not take up too much space on the page.
